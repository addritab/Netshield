# **NETSHIELD**

Netshield is a cybersecurity beginner informative website created by me and three other team members. The intent of this website is to educate the general public on cyber scams and give general advice on how to stay safe. 

## About The Codes

The codes found within the files are all works shared by three other people. The website was created as a final project for the **Kode With Klossy Summer Program**. The files consist of majority of the codes except for two files that were too large to import and the images of the developers.
